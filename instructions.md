# Instructions for Students

Welcome to your website! 

Each group will work together to create an essay page. Then one group member will add a file to class website for your group's song. 


## Understanding Markdown
Your group page needs to follow a few rules so it gets turned into a web page.

For instance, 'Step 1: Understanding Markdown' has two hashtags (`##`) in front of it so that on the published website it displays in a different style from the main body text. 

Using markdown is very easy because knowing only a few of these little characters gives you a lot of power over the appearance of your web page. How do you know what Markdown to use? Just find an example on one of the example pages and copy it!

Your group will work together to create a document using markdown in order to generate a webpage about your song. Create a shared document on a cloud space, such as Google Drive or One Drive. The person in your group in charge of publishing the markdown document on this website will be able to help you check to see what the page looks like as you work.


## Managing Image Files
All group members should save all your images into a shared folder in a cloud location such as Google Drive or One Drive. 

When you download an image for inclusion on your webpage, please change its name according to the following instructions:

- Rename the image to reflect its content.
- Do not use capital letters or spaces in image file names. 
- Please rename the file so that it is all lowercase and there are hypens in between words. (Example: big-image-of-the-band.jpg)
- When you reference your image in the markdown file, ensure that the image file extension matches exactly the file you uploaded. Your image will not work if you type jpg instead of png or jpeg at the end of the file name. Use copy-paste to avoid this.
